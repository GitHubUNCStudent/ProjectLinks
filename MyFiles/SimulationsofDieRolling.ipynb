    "I predicted that the average and standard deviation of the simulation of 100 rolls would be somewhat close to the expected value and standard deviation of the probability distribution for a 20 sided die. And, when running the simulation at n = 100, the average of 10.54 is, indeed, very close to the average for the probability distribution of 10.5.  Likewise, the simulation at n = 100 has a standard deviation of 5.8143  whereas the simulation for the probability distribution is 5.7663.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences can be attributed to the fact that the simulation gives actual data, whereas the probability distribution is the theoretical way that we should expect when the data is known to follow this distribution. It is also important to note that the expected value of 10.5 does not appear on a 20-sided die as a possible outcome, because the die has only discrete integers, whereas the expected value is using continuous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Law of Large Numbers, as n gets larger, the average and standard deviation for the simulations should converge toward the expected value and standard deviation of the probability distribution for a 20 sided die. But, there is always randomness and/or bias, which is why the results of the simulations do not exactly match the probability distribution for the 20-sided die. Notice that with n = 200, the results from the simulation show an average of 10.34, which is not all that close to 10.5. Maybe the difference is just some random noise. However, the Python random number generator has the limitation of using a pseudo-random process, so maybe there is a slight non-randomness effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, when n is increased to 50,000, the average and the standard deviation are both very similar to those of the probability distribution. In summary, the simulation is a good way to illustrate how as large of a sample size as possible should be used in order to achieve results that are more reflective of the true probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this were a real world situation in which the null hypothesis was that the population was evenly distributed between 20 outcomes, then the distributions of the sample into the 20 outcomes would need to be statistically tested (eg. using the chi-square test) to see if the sample of n = 100 represents a significantly different distribution."
