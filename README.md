# Welcome to my repository

## This is a work in progress. I have many improvements and additions to make.

+ ##  [My Fall 2019 Class project](https://github.com/GitHubUNCStudent/BIOS512-assignments/blob/master/FinalProject/RoddenFinalProject_BlogasMarkdownFile.md) with the task of writing a blog post accompanied by data visualization as inspired by [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-was-the-slowest-boston-marathon-since-the-1970s/)


+ ## [Visualization of the most frequent terms](https://github.com/GitHubUNCStudent/BIOS512-assignments/blob/master/README.md)  in the syllabus for Biostatistics 512 class

+ ## Some of the pages from the prototype website built as a proof of concept for FHIR being used for structured data capture and exchange between multi-site IRBs during my internship at Duke University Medical Center:

> http://fhirsirbtesting.pythonanywhere.com/research_studyDB

*Note that many of the links for the FHIR IRB project will not work because I no longer have access to the FHIR server, although I may be replacing the FHIR server with my own database in the future.*
